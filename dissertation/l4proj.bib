	abstract = {"This book explores the efficacy of game-based learning to develop university students' skills and competencies. While writing on game-based learning has previously emphasised the use of games developed specifically for educational purposes, this book fills an important gap in the literature by focusing on commercial games such as World of Warcraft and Minecraft. Underpinned by robust empirical evidence, the author demonstrates that the current negative perception of video games is ill-informed, and in fact these games can be important tools to develop graduate skills related to employability. Speaking to very current concerns about the employability of higher education graduates and the skills that university is intended to develop, this book also explores the attitudes to game-based learning as expressed by instructors, students and game developers. Matthew Barr is Lecturer at the University of Glasgow, UK, where he convened the university's first game studies course and founded the peer reviewed student game studies journal Press Start. He is currently Programme Director for the Graduate Apprenticeship in Software Engineering. He serves as Vice Chair of British DiGRA, sits on the Board of the Scottish Game Developers Association and is the current Chair of the BAFTA Scotland Games Jury." -- prové de l'editor.},

To help students acquire this ability, we conceptualize our notion of self-reﬂection by extending existing models. On this basis, we develop an assessment tool for self-reﬂection. Based on about 300 data sets, we evaluate the quality of our assessment tool by analyzing to what extent it reliably measures the different aspects of self-reﬂection. By performing a Principal Component Analysis, we identify four factors that we relate to the theoretical conceptualization of our notion of self-reﬂection.},

Academics typically interpret such challenges as calls to teach currently fashionable technologies. Strong demand for IT skills in Wellington, New Zealand’s capital, during the past few years has resulted in this being a major area of debate. This research sought to get past the competing claims by examining job advertisements, conducting interviews and focus groups research and found that industry representatives are in fact less concerned about technical skills than ‘soft’ skills needed for team based, customer focused, business environments. Industry tends to seek base-level technical skills and make recruitment decisions on more personal qualities, leaving detailed training to on-the-job. Key soft skills sought by IT employers are identiﬁed to help tertiary educators clarify industry priorities.},

	abstract = {Sustaining students in becoming reflective practitioners is considered as a valued outcome of higher education. The paper aims to evaluate the impact of the learning environment conditions inspired by Schön’s theory of reflective practicum, by discussing a case study of a master’s degree class. The learning environment was designed to sustain reflective practice and meaningful engagement through professional practice simulation, problembased learning and reflective writing. Unlike much of the research into reflective learning, the quality of learning was evaluated by assessing the use of reflective practice in students’ weekly journaling, rather than measuring students’ satisfaction or perceptions of effectiveness. Two hundred and six journal entries of 23 students were assessed and used in a quantitative analysis based on a linear mixed-effects model. Findings indicated that the reflective practicum has an incremental effect on students’ reflective practices and that reflective practice is dynamic and sensitive to specific learning environment conditions. In conclusion, students’ co-responsibility of the learning environment allowed by the professional practice simulation appears to foster meaningful and reflective learning. Conversely, conditions that stimulate only cognitive engagement have little impact or even inhibit reflective practices. Practical implications of the use of reflective journal are discussed.},
