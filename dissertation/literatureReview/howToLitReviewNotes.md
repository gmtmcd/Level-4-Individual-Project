# How to do a literature review (notes based off RMT lecture slides)

## What is literature review
* Discusses the literature on a focussed topic
* Structured summary of the literature â€“ not just list of paper summaries
* Critically reflect on papers individually and collectively
* ID trends, classify solutions, compare methods
* Often aim is to identify a gap where research by you is needed
* Critical summary
* ID different approaches
* ID contradictions
* Analyse the strengths and weaknesses
* Get bigger picture of the literature
* It should reach conclusions
* ID implications for my work

## Searching the literature
* Citation count correlates to impact 
* Look up other papers to see what they site, look for journals or authors that get cited frequently
* ID keywords and concepts
* Keep notes about search terms and advanced search paths
* Get list of papers
* Screen each for relevance
* Keep all the meta-data for the papers organised

## Planning lit review
* ID aims - to better understand a topic and to provide motivation
* Structure
    - start high-level
    - What are key topics (main headings)
    - Work down
    - ID uses of grad attributes, structure based on that
    - ID reflections, structure based on that
    - Unify the areas - think of logical order (attributes then reflections)
    -
