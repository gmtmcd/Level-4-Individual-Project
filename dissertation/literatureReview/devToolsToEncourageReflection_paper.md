# R. McDermott, G.Brindley, G.Eccleston
# Summary

## Notes from reading paper
* Experiment will use blogs where students have to reflect on their learning experience
* This was to encourage the development of critical and analytical skills for reflection
* The reflective practice is good for developing lifelong skills to help with employability
* The blog could be used also in the future as a portfolio of all the skills and developments they have made
* Issues- students find it hard to reflect without some sort of assistance to support it, teachers find it hard to promote, ability to reflect is learned over time
* Also allows students to monitor their own progress and identify strengths and weaknesses they may have
* They could also be asked to give examples of good work to form a portfolio or how they would improve on previous work
* They had to identify what they had learned and what strategies they had adopted
* Attibutes here include: exercising critical thinking, access, evaluate and synthesise information, to communicate effectively, to work successfully both independently and in teams, and to demonstrate leadership, professional behaviour and ethical practices
* The academic measure of this project was the degree students increased their confidence in their ability to self regulate
* It also examined three attributes of student work: critical analysis of arguments, reflection on their own work and academic writing skills
* It put out questionaires for the students to fill out 
* Students responding positively increased in each category other than academic writing where it stayed the same
* Four levels of reflection:
- Descriptive writing: Non-reflective, simply desccribes experience
- Descriptive reflection: Student tries to give reasons for their learning based on personal judgements
- Dialogic reflection: User explores reasons why things happened
- Critical reflection: elaborate on the reasons they learned and the decisions they made
* There was improvement in the reflections over the year
* questionnaires showed students felt good about reflection
