# Teaching computing soft skills: An experiential approach
# K. Abernethy, K. Treu
# Summary

## Notes from reading paper
* This paper focussed on soft skills being learning within computing science
* It agreed with other papers that although reflection and having these attributes taught to you is good, there is no better way to learn them than through real-world experiences
* The project created in the paper for students was similar to the thirs year team project in which teams of students were tasked with communicating with each other and a real-world client in order to produce a product
* The paper states that the ability of communication is vital to a compsci graduates success within the job
* Its a key area of weakness as stated by employers that graduates are not able to communicate with clients and other team members
* This paper also states that employers do not rely on technical skills when hiring someone and are more liekly to look for these soft skills as they are required to gain a clear statement of what a client wants
* Grads must make sre that clients are involved, that they manage these clients well and make sure their expectations are realistic, they must also be able to gain requirements and monitor progress and risk, adjusting the project schedule as required
* Overall, to be a good software engineer, you must have good communication and interpersonal skills
* "there is no substitute for experience"
* *The goal of my project will not be entirely to teach these skills but instead will make users more aware of these skills and when they are using them. This will mean they are then able to reflect on them and therefore encourage devlopement of them*
* So the project followed similarly to how the team project went for third years, students had to meet with clients and carry out the entire project development
- requirements gathering
- discuss issues
- create design
- status reports
- present the project
* With a project manager being appointed who was in charge of:
- regular communications
- scheduling and managing meetings
- meeting with lecturers
- keeping a journal of team activity
- progress reports
- assigning tasks
- reviewing work
* Overall from this project studets learned the skills in written and oral communication
* The paper gives good examples of styles of questions that can be asked for students to reflect on the experience
* The project was a success and providing evidence that real-world experience is most efficient in learning these skills
* *For my project this is important as the questions i ask users will relate too their own real world experiences and ask them to reflect of these and to think about these experiences as learning opputunities for their soft skills*
