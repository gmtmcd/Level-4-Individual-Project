# M.Barr summary

* Need to find a link to this paper so that it can be added to Zotero reference holder

## Notes from review
* Way of identifying and quantifying the skills students learn during education that arent necessarily to do with their degree
* Critical thinking, problem-solving and self-organisation
* Enhance employability skills
* Developed through learning 
* Empahsis on problem-solving and reflection
* Reflection allows consolidation of skills as person has to think about what they learned and how they learned it 
* Creates a self-awareness
* "Question of whether university courses are explicitly designed to develop generic attributes is perhaps not satisfactorily answered in the literature, despite what universities and other institutions might claim."
* (The page on moodle claimed that at university all students will learn these skills through their courses annd through their extra-curricular activities)
* University lecturers are not equipped with what grad attributes are or how to teach them, theres a lot of confusion over what they are and you can't develop skills if you dont know what they are
* **Perhaps could do a little tutorial page in the app to teach students what these graduate attributes are, if the students are more aware of the things that they are learning then they'll be able to reflect more efficiently, the more reflection a student is able to do the more they develop these skills**
* These skills cant be gained from a lecture based system
* Theres no motivation for lecturers to learn how to teach these skills
* Students rarely opt into classes to learn these skills, even though it would benefit them
* Useful quote from the paper:
 "Tell me and I will forget,
 Show me and I may remember,
 Involve me and I will understand"

## Level 1 

### Summary paragraph
Graduate attributes are skills learned during someones time at university, that arent necessarily a direct result of the courses they are doing. These can involve problem-solving, critical thinking and self-organisation. These skills increase a persons employability but are often not developed or reflected upon, this is due to a lack of understanding over what these skills actually are and how an indivdual learns them. There are not enough resources or motivations for people to learn and develop these skills.

### Relevance
This paper was written by my supervisor and gives examples of what graduate attributes are and why they are not taught or developed

### Personal view
Good - will give a good source to cite in the dissertation of why i am following up with my own research into grad attibutes and reflections on them. Learned that graduate attributes are not something that is taught (rare for people to know what they are) and that motivations to do so are very low. Also learned that there is a gap in the research on whether or not universities are designed to teach these skills

## Level 2

### Summary
*Context*: Read aa a recommendation, what i have learned is as stated above
*Problem*:
