# Graduate Skills and Game-Based Learning - Using video games for employability in Higher Education
# M.Barr 
# Summary

* Need to find a link to this paper so that it can be added to Zotero reference holder

## Notes from review
* Way of identifying and quantifying the skills students learn during education that arent necessarily to do with their degree
* Critical thinking, problem-solving and self-organisation
* Enhance employability skills
* Developed through learning 
* Empahsis on problem-solving and reflection
* Reflection allows consolidation of skills as person has to think about what they learned and how they learned it 
* Creates a self-awareness
* "Question of whether university courses are explicitly designed to develop generic attributes is perhaps not satisfactorily answered in the literature, despite what universities and other institutions might claim."
* (The page on moodle claimed that at university all students will learn these skills through their courses annd through their extra-curricular activities)
* University lecturers are not equipped with what grad attributes are or how to teach them, theres a lot of confusion over what they are and you can't develop skills if you dont know what they are
* **Perhaps could do a little tutorial page in the app to teach students what these graduate attributes are, if the students are more aware of the things that they are learning then they'll be able to reflect more efficiently, the more reflection a student is able to do the more they develop these skills**
* These skills cant be gained from a lecture based system
* Theres no motivation for lecturers to learn how to teach these skills
* Students rarely opt into classes to learn these skills, even though it would benefit them
* Useful quote from the paper:
 "Tell me and I will forget,
 Show me and I may remember,
 Involve me and I will understand"

## Level 1 

### Summary paragraph
Graduate attributes are skills learned during someones time at university, that arent necessarily a direct result of the courses they are doing. These can involve problem-solving, critical thinking and self-organisation. These skills increase a persons employability but are often not developed or reflected upon, this is due to a lack of understanding over what these skills actually are and how an indivdual learns them. There are not enough resources or motivations for people to learn and develop these skills.

### Relevance
This paper was written by my supervisor and gives examples of what graduate attributes are and why they are not taught or developed

### Personal view
Good - will give a good source to cite in the dissertation of why i am following up with my own research into grad attibutes and reflections on them. Learned that graduate attributes are not something that is taught (rare for people to know what they are) and that motivations to do so are very low. Also learned that there is a gap in the research on whether or not universities are designed to teach these skills

## Level 2

### Summary
*Context*: Read as a recommendation, what i have learned is as stated above
*Problem*: The difficulty of learning graduate attributes and how video games could be used to help develop them
*Contribution*: Showed how games can be used to develop graduate attributes
*Related work*: 
* Communicative Adaptability Scale (CAS)
* I-Adapt scale
* Rosenberg Self esteem scale
* General self efficacy scale
*Methods*: Two groups of students were used, the intervention group participated in various video games that were chosen as possible to develop their grad attributes and one was a control group that did not play any games. They were tested in terms of effective communicators, adaptability and resourcefulness and responsibilty before and after the sessions of playing games with the difference being used for the results. 
*Outcomes*: For every attribute measurement it was seen that the skills had increased, however there was no significant difference in self esteem and self efficacy (the belief that you can succeed-confidence)
*Conclusions*: These skills can clearly be improved through the use of video games, it has also provided measure to quantify graduate attributes and more examples of what these graduate attributes are.
So therefore has provided me with further research to go on from.

## Info found about the scales
* The Communicative Adaptability Scale (CAS) was used - designed to measure ability to see and understand socio-interpersonal relationships and adapt interaction behaviours to match it
* The I-Adapt scale (Polyhart & Blise 2006) can measure both individual and team adaptability. It is described as  “… an individual’s ability, skill, disposition, willingness, and/or motivation, to change or fit different task, social, and environmental features”
* Rosenberg Self esteem scale gives a list of statements where someone has to answer from strongly agree to strongly disagree. It gives statements that reflect on how someone feels about themselves, eg whether they have things to be proud of, whether they compare well to other people
* General self efficacy scale assesses whether or not someone believes in themselves to cope with lifes demands. It gives them 10 statements whihc they rate out of 4 from Not true at all to Exactly true. These statements discuss whether they think they can solve problems or accomplish goals for example.
