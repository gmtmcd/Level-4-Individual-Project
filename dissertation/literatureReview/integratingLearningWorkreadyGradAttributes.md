# Summary

## Notes from reading paper
* Every employer wants graduates with the necessaary skills for employment
* This paper identifies 11 key work-ready skills
* There are several reports that believe it is the university's responsibility to train grauates to have these skills that increase their employability
* However, unis focus more on course material and technical skills
* The amount of empoyers that are requiring these non-technical skills are incresing so rapidly that universities are having to reconsider their teaching models
* However, teaching these things cannot replace the real-world learning that occurs when people carry out tasks that develop these skills
* This paper included a literature review, also included summarised response from surveys sent out to experts
* *I could do a survey asking if people know what grad attributes are, have they ever heard the term, etc*
* Employers believe that while technical skills are important, they are more likely to hire based on graduate skills that will improve how the graduate copes with day to day activities on the job as technical skills can be taught on the job, gradutate skills cannot

* The key attributes employers looked for were:
- Ethics and professionalism
    * Acting ethically
    * Responsibility 
    * Maturity
    * Respect
    * Integrity
    * Continual learning
    * Leadership
    * How someone presents themselves in a work environment
    * Proactive
- Global perspective
    * Understanding and awareness of the world
    * Lets them have the ability to understand clients issues
    * Understand other cultures and environments
    * Seen as a key weakness for graduates
- Communication capacity
    * Oral and written (eg email) communication
    * Be clear and concise
    * Be able to interrogate ideas and understand them
    * Be able to present ideas persuasively and to a ranging audience
    * Graduates have been found to lack confidence in this area
- Ability to work well in a team
    * Teamwork was found to be critical
    * Collab and reach a consensus
- Ability to apply knowledge
    * Take the technical knowledge gained throughout university and apply it in the workplace
- Creative problem solving and critical thinking skills
    * Understand the client and create a solution that works for them
    * Clients want innovative ideas with modern solutions
    * This ability to be creative is another key weakness in graduates

* The paper identified overall 11 attributes however i feel the above are the key ones that i will focus on
* Sadly the project this paper made is no longer available online to explore
* *My app will be more generic rather than specific to certain fields of work, therefore something to consider in the evaluation is whether a possible improvement could have been to make it more specific*
* *Consider in the future, is my app easy to use and navigate, is it valuable*
