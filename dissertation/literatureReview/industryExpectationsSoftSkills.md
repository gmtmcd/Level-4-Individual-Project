# Industry Expectations of Soft Skills in IT Graduates
# M. Stevens, R. Norman
# Summary

## Notes from reading paper
* This paper focused mainly on IT graduates but also talked a little in general about any field
* 
* Industry will regularly question whether or not graduates are ready to join the workplace
* This study found that industry is less concerned about the technical skills that graduates come out with than the soft skills they have
* These skills are needed for the workplace as they are crucial for team work, and customer interactions
* Companies look for the base-level of technical skills (as you only need to show technical competence to enter the industry) and make the hiring decision based more on these personal qualities and soft skills
* This is because the majority of the technical skills needed for any job will be taught once the graduate starts
* This paper also found that there was little eagerness from universities to collaborate with industry in providing these oppurtunities for students to learn soft skills that will help them with employability as unis see it as their responsibility is to teach technical skills
* This study included acquiring the job listings for 543 technical jobs and studying whether or not they asked for soft skills
* 60% of these adverts required 2 or more soft skills
* The Study also interviewed companies that would hire people for technical based jobs
* The interviewees stated that very few of them were able to identify the level of technical skill from just university qualitifications and that these qualitifications just looked generic to them
* However, every interviewee was adament that soft skills were necessary
* They stated that soft skills allow an employee to integrate better into the team and help to create relationships with customers, creating better business
* They require employee to be able to gain respect, deliver, be honest and ethical, communication, and presentation
* One interviewee states "professionalism is both doing the right thing (technical skills) and being seen to do the right thing (soft skills)"
* However, learning of soft skills should never come before learning the technical skills
* The key attributes listed by the study are :
    - Communication
    - Interpersonal skills (remembering names, social cues, being yourself)
    - Managing yourself
    - Attitude (optimistic, willing)
    - Understand business drivers 
    - Teamwork
    - Cultural fit (fit in socially within the workplace)
* The study also notes that students are not aware of soft skills and that they are important for employability, and that students are not prepared for the workplace
