# Level-4-Individual-Project
Repository to contain the code, timelog, status report, data, and dissertation for my 4th year individual project at the University of Glasgow. The supervisor for this project is Dr Matthew Barr.

The project was to create a mobile application to capture graduate attribute reflections. This was done via an iOS mobile app that integrated Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) techniques and questions in order to promote deeper and more meaningful reflection from students. 

A research survey was conducted to determine students knowledge of graduate attributes, their importance, and their experience with reflection. 

Following this an exploratory study was carried out to examine whether CBT techniques were beneficial to reflection by students on their graduate attributes. This study used A/B testing.

The mobile app, GradReflect, was then created and evaluations were conducted on the app to determine its usability, benefits for students and whether users would want to continue using the application.
