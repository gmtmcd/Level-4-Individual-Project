This mobile app would allow students – including apprentices in the workplace – to capture their reflections on how they have developed their graduate attributes [1]. Reflecting on how we have exercised our critical thinking, creativity, or adaptability is an important part of how we develop such skills. However, finding the time to record these reflections is often a challenge, and it is easy to forget to make of note of incidences where we might have exercised the skills in question. The app would allow users to quickly make a note of how and when they have used these skills at university or in the workplace, either in text form or as an audio recording. The interface here will be key – it must be as simple and as quick as possible to record and categorise these reflections. The app should also allow users to configure reminders to record their reflections and, ideally, allow users to export their reflections for upload to Moodle or some other system. While development of the app is an important component of the project, evaluation and analysis aspects of the app will be equally important here.
