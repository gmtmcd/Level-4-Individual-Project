# Initial Meeting with Supervisor – 06/10/2020

## What I have done
* Research a bit into swift, kotlin and dart and created a document with what I’d found and any tutorials and YouTube videos that looked like they would be useful if I used that language
* In the end I decided I’d like to use Swift for an iOS app
* Created a mind map of ideas that I could implement in the app
* Read the graduate skill Moodle page that I had been sent
* Explored Mahara

## Questions to ask
* What time for future meetings? 
    - Next week: Friday 16th at 11am

* Should I prepare and submit anything for future meetings? 
    - If I send him something send it a couple days in advance, the day before or day of is not enough time for him to look at it

* Can I create an iOS app? – Swift
    - Yes
    - If it was to be distributed out as an app, you would not be able to exclude certain users but for this project it is fine
    - Say in report that we discussed using iOS in the beginning and that it was fine
    - And also that its not feasible for a level 4 project
    - Need to look into if I have to have a license for it
    - Could also do a web app and then wrap it using something like ‘Phone Gap’

* Do I need to do literature reviews, do I need to find other apps that are similar to review?
    - Glasgow uni’s Mahara
    - A literature review must be done
    - Scope out what out there already
    - This is going to be more of a research project rather than just development
    - Find where I want to put the emphasis

* Research –
    - Literature review
        - Research studies
        - Look at reflection
    - Evaluation 
        - More than getting someone to say that’s fine
        - In depth interviews – what is useful, what they like
    - Software might not be bells and whistles, but the research should be strong and more of it
    - HCI – research, could make different layouts and give those to survey participants
    - Evaluation is important
        - Don’t neglect it as they can be easy marks
        -Evaluation is where research comes from

* Should we continue to contact you through email, or would you prefer Microsoft teams?
    - Email is better

* Should I do any user surveys? – asking different styles of question to see what kind get the most responses
    - Yes, good idea
    - Decide from this what angle I want to take in terms of research
    - Could focus on the reflection aspect and what style of prompt provokes the best reflection
    - What reflection is
    - How these reflections will benefit the user
    - The more they reflect the more they develop those skills

* Extra
    - Grad attributes will come out of the university experience, perhaps a little bit from a part time job
    - For testing can use anyone, can use peers who are uni students

## Next steps from Matthew:
* Do a literature review, orient you in the space, expand the topics
* Grad attributes can be called by different names at times i.e. – skills, soft skills, employability skills
* He will send us his paper on graduate skills to review
* Find something in literature about reflection
* Create a timeline
	

## Extra plan items for this week and maybe next
* Get XCode set up on the Mac
* Watch the XCode tutorials
* Start to create plans for how I want the app to look and how I want it to work (wireframes)
* Start thinking of the prompting questions I want it to ask people
* MoSCoW?
* Start creating issues in the GitHub for things I want to do
* Send over all the materials I create this week 
* User stories?
* Mahara research
