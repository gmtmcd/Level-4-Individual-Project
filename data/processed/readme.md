# Processed Data

## Plan to process the data
  
### General Attribute survey
* Google forms already is able to turn the yes/no answers into pie charts so is already pretty much processed
* Group together all the open-ended questions in one excel spreadsheet and start to create a key where key concepts are mentioned
* Then count how many people mention the key concepts
* Write a doc with the comments about the results of the survey

### Experimental Survey group - ab test
* Lay out the responses grouped by the participant
* Create a key of colours that represent the different stages of reflection
* Go through each response and if the complete a stage of reflection add the corresponding colour to their answer
* At the end count how many people went through each stage of reflection
* See if it shows that they reflect well

### Control Survey group - ab test
* Lay out the responses grouped by the participant
* Create a key of colours that represent the different stages of reflection
* Go through each response and if the complete a stage of reflection add the corresponding colour to their answer
* At the end count how many people went through each stage of reflection
* See if it shows that they reflect well
