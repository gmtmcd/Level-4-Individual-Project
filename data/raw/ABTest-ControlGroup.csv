I also attended every meeting and event and was ready at least 10 minutes beforehand so that I was never late","My honours project required the participation of others for a survey I was doing. I ensured that i did not break any ethical rules and recieved written and spoken consent from everyone.","I think my teamwork and communication skills are strong as I like to keep organised and ensure everyone has a role and knows what they are doing. I feel like i am a good team leader as i dont like to leave things to the last minute","My application of knowledge could definitely be improved as sometimes I don't recognise the full extent of my knowledge of a subject so don't always speak up when i actually do know the correct direction","In a team project i was part of, we all had roles in which we had to stick to and certain tasks we thought we could accomplish by  the next week. I had said I would do something which turned out to be a lot harder than expected and due to this and other coursework that I had, I never got it finished for our customer meeting. ","I would try to remain impartial if the situation is between two others in my group and i would try to understand both sides before trying to reconcile them. If they are unwilling to cooperate, then I may feel as though it would be appropriate to talk to someone higher up. 
I don't like being in conflict with others so if the situation involved me then i would try to talk to the others and explain my side and how i was feeling about it and hope that they would respond positively and we could work it out."
