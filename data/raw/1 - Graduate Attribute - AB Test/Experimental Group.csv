"Timestamp","Do you agree to participate in this survey?","What graduate skill did you develop?","Describe a situation in which you developed this skill. [The situation is the concrete experience, this only covers the facts of what happened with no interpretation. An example could include settling a dispute between peers for Teamwork]","What were your thoughts during this experience? [Thoughts help to interpret a situation, there are different ways to interpret a single situation. These thoughts can be positive or negative. For example, that you were thinking that a dispute between your peers could cause delays further down the line, that you thought it could damage the overall harmony of the team, etc]","How did you feel during this situation? [These emotions will be based on your thoughts about the experience and can be both negative and positive. This scale does not describe the scenario, but instead your emotional response to the experience.]","Why do you think you felt this way? [Reasons behind your emotions can stem from many things, it could be as a result of previous experiences, foreseeable impacts, etc. Continuing the team dispute example, a reason someone would feel negatively about the team dispute could be that it has happened in a previous team and resulted in a bad team environment, an example of why they could feel positively about it could be that it gave them the opportunity to take on a proactive role in settling the dispute and creating a good environment or their team.]","How did you behave in this experience? [This requires you to examine the cause and effect.  How does the resulting behaviour directly relate to your thoughts and feelings? For example, someone taking the two arguing team members aside and discussing with them how to sort the dispute and compromise. This could be because they did not want to ruin the team environment that had been positive up until the dispute, and wanted to create the best product they could as a team.]","How would you want to behave in the future? Would you act the same or differently, and why? [Here we are examining alternate thought. You have to examine all of your previous answers and decide if this is how you would handle another similar situation and whether the behaviour you had resulted in the best possible outcome. This will help you to make new connections and create different, more positive experiences in the future. For example, someone might behave in the same way in settling the dispute, however they may act sooner next time to ensure there is no impact on team cohesion.]"

However, it definitely helped that I wasn't dealing with these issues alone and that the team managers and my line manager were all very supportive and were encouraging of my strategies to adapt.","Throughout I tried to keep active communication with my team members and my line manager to ensure that they knew I was working on addressing these issues. This helped me to feel more in control of the situation, and also helped to alleviate my concerns that I was making a poor impression. ","I think I'd behave roughly the same, hopefully acting with a bit more confidence in myself doing everything I could do in the situation. I also think I'd log more of what my problems actually were and how I could / was solving them, again to help alleviate any stress I would be feeling but also to solidify improvement in dealing with these kinds of situations."
"2020/11/10 11:21:05 AM GMT","Yes","Communication","I undertook a research project as my dissertation and had to effectively communicate my findings at a symposium ","If I did not communicate effectively my dissertation mark would be lowered. I also wanted people to understand my research project to allow accurate feedback. ","4","I feel it was a positive experience as it has improved my confidence with regards to public speaking. I also feel I understood my project better as I had to effectively communicate the results to people who hadn't read the literature. ","Struggling with public speaking I practiced in front of different people before the symposium. This boosted my confidence and made my presentation flow more natural which I believe helped engage the audience more. ","I would do the same again, however I would practise more in different settings to make me feel more comfortable. I would also practice with different target audiences to ensure I fully understood my project. "
"2020/11/10 11:52:45 AM GMT","Yes","Teamwork","I helped settle a disagreement within my group for a group work project","The group project was graded and a substantial percent of our coursework, so I was worried that if we couldn’t agree on an angle to take soon that we would be rushed and not produce our best work. ","2","I felt frustrated that we couldn’t agree, partly because I couldn’t understand where other members of the team where coming from with their thought process. I was also stressed about not being productive during our team meeting. However, I didn’t feel worried that the group would no longer get along. I felt that once the disagreement was over we would get along again as we all had a good relationship.","I suggested that we should make pros and cons for both arguments on a word document so every body in the group can fully see both sides of the argument. I then suggested we should do a group vote after everybody read the facts and had a few minutes to make their mind up. I wanted to give everybody the chance to fully think about both arguments and decide what was best for the project. I also wanted to create a fair environment, and a space for everybody to make a decision in the most efficient way possible to allow us to get on with the project.","I feel that in the same situation, I would suggest the same thing as it was really effective. However, I would try not to get so frustrated by taking time to listen to others with different view points and suggesting the same action quicker."
"2020/11/10 2:58:59 PM GMT","Yes","Communication","Integrated Systems Design Project 4 - working with 6 other teammates I had never met before (all from different degree disciplines). We had to learn to describe our own technical work in a way that was easily understandable to eachother. ","I was initially nervous about meeting and working with my new team. I was concerned that some people would not pull their weight, or that I would be unable to contribute in a meaningful way. I was also concerned that the coordination of 7 different timetables for meetings would reduce our ability to have an effective meeting schedule. 

What I actually experienced was far more positive than I could have imagined. My team got along very well and everyone was able to contribute. I believe that this is because we were all aware of the potential for things to go wrong, so everyone made an active effort to try and communicate frequently and effectively. ","5","I think I was concerned because of the reputation the course had, which had influenced my views and made me aware of the different communication breakdowns experienced by teams in previous years. ","I think that my proactive approach to team communication was effective. We ensured that everyone had weekly objectives, and that no one felt afraid to ask for help if they needed it. I think this fostered a friendly and approachable environment within the team, which was essential as this was our first experience of working together. ","I think I would behave the same way, I was very proud of how my team worked together. Through communication we were able to make everyone feel comfortable from the outset, and I believe this gave us the best outcome. "
"2020/11/10 4:54:53 PM GMT","Yes","Teamwork","My team for a project were not comfortable with each other.","This happened at the start of the project, and my initial thoughts were along the lines of ""we aren't going to get much work done if we don't talk much"". Because of this, at the start, we all worked individually which furthered the divide between the group.

I was optimistic though, as this is a very normal experience in new teams.","4","Although we didn't glue right at the start of the project, I was fairly optimistic that we could become closer, just by spending more time together.

I really enjoy the idea of bringing people together in general, so this wasn't as negative for me as it may be for some others.

I'm quite an introverted person, but in seeing people who are more introverted than myself, I end up supporting those people because I can relate to them. I see it as an opportunity to help someone out.","I tried to encourage everyone to chat, first about uni (as that's something we could all relate to), and then onto more general topics (TV shows, movies, interests, etc.) just so everyone would be more comfortable.

I started with myself, as other people are generally a lot more open to talking about semi-personal things after you've shared a bit yourself.

And from that, the team, week by week, progressively got closer and closer. While I wouldn't credit myself for this, I'm just happy I got to encourage some people out of their shell by first coming out of mine.","I think the way I behaved was great! Nothing went wrong, and what happened is the best thing that could've.

However, to answer the question, if I were to go through that again, from then, I've become a lot more confident, even though I'd still probably call myself quite an introvert. But I'm quite happy to talk in smaller groups of 4/5. From this, yeah, I'd maybe chat with them more casually earlier so we could be closer from the start."
