2020/11/10 2:20:38 PM GMT,Yes,No,,Yes,"I've experienced classes aimed at developing soft skills, such as Engineering Skills 1 & 2. Whilst these were useful, I believe that I improved these skills most by taking part in extra cirricular activities and student teams. ",Yes,,Yes,"Yes, I think this is mostly because of working in such a new environment (i.e. WFH and online work). It is more obvious that there are various skills required and necessary that perhaps weren't before. ",Yes,"Yes, but I hadn't heard the term graduate skills before, so may have needed it explained to me.

2020/11/10 4:38:04 PM GMT,Yes,No,,Yes,"The importance of these skills hasn't *explicitly* been explained, but more implicitly, just in the way in which say, communication is important because (for most professions) you'll need to know how to effectively work in a team, convey an idea in a concise manner, etc.",Yes,"I personally think university doesn't do a great job of developing these skills inherently. It's more up to the individual person to work on their critical thinking/teamwork/etc skills.

However, if you let it, university can be a great place to learn and develop your graduate attributes.",Yes,"Even small things, like organising your personal life, talking to friends, solving problems (university or otherwise) can all contribute to the development of graduate attributes. (and we do all of these every day)",Yes,"Before this survey, I hadn't particularly heard of the specific term ""graduate attributes"" (or skills) and rather just thought about them as soft skills, etc.

But to answer the question, yeah, with almost 4 years of university, I feel as if I have a good idea of what I'm good at, and what I'm not good at.",Yes,"For the interviews I have been to, they have assessed my critical thinking, application of knowledge and professionalism. I'd expect for them to implicitly be evaluating my communication, teamwork and adaptability skills as well.",Yes,"I think reflecting on things that happen in your life is a normal part - however many people don't sit down and deliberately think about doing it, they just do it as part of their day.",No,"After anything happens, I like to think about if I reacted to the situation properly. However, sometimes I get a bit carried away, as I'm usually quite anxious thinking if I'm ""acting"" the right way.

I always try to make sure my emotional response to situations is justified, and I always try to keep my emotions in check. From practice, I've definitely gotten better at it than I used to be, as I've grown older."
