* The General Attribute Knowledge survey contained information based on what students know already about graduate attributes and how much experience they have with these attributes and reflecting on them
* The survey followed a format of Yes/No questions, but after every question there was the opportunity for participants to give any written feedback on the question and allowed for more input from the participants
* From these Google Forms - an excel spreadsheet CSV file was created which contained the answers to the surveys
* This excel spreadsheet does not contain any names of participants and is anonymous 
* None of the answers were modified from the original answers within the Google Forms
