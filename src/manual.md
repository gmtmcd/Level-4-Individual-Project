To build the app, the simulated iPhone can be used. To do this the large Play button on the toolbar at the top of XCode should be pressed after choosing the iOS device to build the app on. iPhone 11 Pro is recommended as this was the phone that was used during the majority of development. 
The app can then be interacted with as it will build onto the simulated device in the same way it would on a physical device. The app can be interacted with using the mouse and keyboard to type.

The app will open on the Home page. From here users can swipe to read each of the different skill cards containing a description of the skill and example of where it is used. The first skill card contains a brief description of the app and what each section is for.

The notes section allows users to capture a reflection on their graduate attributes by clicking the new note button in the top right corner of the screen.

Help buttons are available for additional assistance in answering each question. For a note to be saved it requires at least a title. The search feature allows for searching of the note title or skill type to display a list of filtered notes. Notes can be deleted using the Edit button at the bottom of the screen. To review a note previously made, the user can tap on it.

In the recordings section, users can enter a name into the text field and then click to record a note, and click again to stop recording. Audio recordings do not require a title.

Each title given is followed by the date and time of when the recording was made in the display list. Notes can be played back using the play buttons beside each notes and deleted using the edit button at the bottom of the screen.
