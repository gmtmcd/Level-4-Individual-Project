They are considered vital in the workplace, with employers often noting that these skills are considered more important than technical based skills that can be taught after hiring.\n\nThese can involve, but are not limited to:\n - Communication \n - Critical thinking \n - Adaptability \n - Teamwork \n - Self-efficacy \n - Application of knowledge \n - Ethics \n - Professionalism.\n\nBy using CBT techniques this app hopes to encourage the development of these skills that evolve through your real-world experiences and reflection.")

Each note takes a CBT approach to the questions it asks, encouraging deeper and more meaningful reflections that will help you develop an awareness of how and when you use these skills.\n\nEach section reflects the CBT model of Situation, Thoughts, Emotions, Behaviour and Future Alternative Thought/Behaviour.\n\nNotes require a title to be saved. Once saved notes can be reviewed and deleted, they cannot be edited to immitate the written note format of CBT. There is also a search functionality that can be used to search for the title of a note or a skill type to filter the notes shown by a skill.")

This will name the recording your chosen name followed by the date and time of the recording. If no name is given the recording will just be given the date and time. \n\nIf you want to make two recordings in a row, the previous recording title must be removed from the text field to enter in the new one or leave it blank.\n\nRecordings can be played back, paused, and deleted.\n\nTo enable recordings you must allow access to the microphone in the settings for this app on your device.")
